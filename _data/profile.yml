  <p>
    I am a recent graduate in Computer Science from <a href="https://vinuni.edu.vn" target="_blank">VinUniversity</a>, where I focused on artificial intelligence and research at the intersection of machine learning and robotics.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve worked on research projects related to small language models, adversarial robustness, scene graph neural networks, and AI-driven path planning. I’ve published works on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00831" target="_blank">LLM-guided distillation</a> and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988892" target="_blank">adversarial attacks</a> in top venues. I also interned at <a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg" target="_blank">A*STAR Singapore</a> and contributed to production AI systems at <a href="https://coccoc.com/" target="_blank">Cốc Cốc</a> impacting millions of users.
