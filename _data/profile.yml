  <p>
    Upcoming AI Engineer at BioTuring, and a self-motivated researcher. 
  </p>
  <p>
   I previously worked as a <strong>Data Scientist at Cốc Cốc</strong>, the only Vietnamese search engine and browser. 
   I developed ML models and optimized product features to impact 30M monthly users with 600M search queries/month. I contributed 3 services for Cốc Cốc AI Answer feature, and 1 service for Cốc Cốc SERP feature.
  </p>
  <p>
   I was a <strong>Research Intern at A*STAR Singapore</strong>, researched on adversarial robustness. 
   I first-authored a research publication at IEEE TNNLS (Q1). 
   I worked under the supervision of  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yJpx_WoAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Zhang Wenyu</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
   I was a <strong>Research Assistant at VinUniversity</strong>, researched on scene understanding and language models (LLMs/SLMs) for resource-constrained tasks. 
   I contributed to several research publications as co-first author, collaborated with researchers from UAB, USA and MBZUAI, UAE.
   I worked under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CCQ6CH4AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Professor Do Tho Truong</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  My other research co-authors included <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jdSlREMAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Professor Dezhen Song, MBZUAI</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JiKBo6UAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Professor Hy Truong Son, UAB</a>
  </p>
  <p>
  I've been fortunate to earn some meaningful accomplishments, but also faced many rejections along the way. 
  On this site, I share not just my successes, but also the rejections — whether in research submissions, university applications, or job interviews.
  I hope to give you a more honest glimpse into the journey that reflects my human experience.
