  We propose a novel framework leveraging LLMs as teacher models to train lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) for high-level path planning tasks. The SLMs are trained in a simulation-powered, interleaved manner with LLM-guided SFT and RL. This strategy not only enables SLMs to successfully complete navigation tasks but also makes them aware of important factors like travel distance and number of trials.
